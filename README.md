Commercializing quantum tech breakthroughs in Africa

## Start Here

## Why we exist

We help entrepreneurial scientists, businesses, investors, and policymakers in Africa find their path to success with quantum technologies today.

Quantum technology is an emerging field of science and engineering that leverages laws of quantum mechanics to provide unprecedented advances in secure communication, sensing, and computational power.

The first quantum technology revolution brought new fundamental concepts and capabilities such as a laser, GPS, semiconductors, nuclear magnetic resonance, or superconductivity. The second quantum technology revolution harnesses physics at the atomic scale. It allows controlling and manipulating individual quantum states leading to a wave of new technologies that will create many new businesses that help solve many of today's global challenges.  Africa's competitive advantage is its talented young population and abundant natural resource. It simply cannot afford to be left out of the quantum revolution, which will sit at the core of building new enterprises, future careers, and workforces, as well as driving accessible innovation.

QuantumTech.Africa is the first start up in Africa that is purely focused on commercializing quantum tech breakthroughs. In summary:

- We help build investable companies and invest in promising quantum tech startups. 

We work closely with founders to help them grow their companies, gain access to corporates, partners and experts to improve business outcomes and attract funding.

- We guide businesses in their quantum tech projects and initiatives.

We engage with corporates to learn about their medium to long-tern goals, provide visibility and access to quantum tech and enable collaboration with the quantum tech community to solve key challenges across various industries.

- We support policymakers to knock down barriers and make it easy to commercialize quantum tech innovations.

- We gather top talent in quantum in the continent and bring together great minds across the ecosystem in think and do tanks to discuss, share and inspire ideas of innovation.

## Why our website is on GitHub

We believe in transparency — how we think, what we believe and why — is the first step to build trust.

We've moved our entire web presence to GitHub to become more transparent. Here, you can see how things have changed over time, propose improvements, or even take our ideas and make them your own (the relationships are ours, though). You can also see the things you'd usually find on a company website, like a list of our founders and the questions we ask ourselves when making business decisions. We're grateful you're taking the time to learn about us.

We decided to take a chance and open source to save our clients time and help them decide whether to work with us. (The ones who want to skip talking to us also save a step, which is terrific. Our time is precious.) We hope to see stars and forks so we can go even further.
